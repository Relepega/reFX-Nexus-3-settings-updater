1) install the latest python release, and when asked, check the "add to PATH" box
2) make sure python is installed correctly by using "python -V" in the cmd or powershell and then proceed to the next step
	NOTE: DO NOT PROCEED IF IT DOES GIVE THE ERROR "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."
3) run "pip install pyinstaller"
4) double-click on "build.bat" and let it work
5) if everything went smoothly you should see a file called "update_nexus_library_location.exe" in the project directory
6) copy the freshly-built file to the root directory of the nexus library
	example: i placed the file in "E:\Presets\Nexus Content", check readme.png
